      "description": "My name is Uciel Sola, and I'm a driven Frontend Developer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. With a passion for solving problems and a strong foundation in user experience principles, I craft intuitive digital experiences. My expertise includes TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like Svelte, React, Vue, and Angular.\n\nAt [Viset](https://www.visetlab.com/en), I enhanced the user experience of a mobile app with 200+ daily users, focusing on intuitive navigation and seamless interactions. Additionally, I streamlined internal processes by developing custom admin panels for efficient user and content management.\n\nFor [Mercanis](https://mercanis.com), I built client-tailored software solutions, prioritizing user-friendly interfaces for improved adoption and efficiency. I collaborated with product designers to define and implement new features based on user feedback, and actively participated in expanding our development team through technical interviews.\n\nI'm adaptable, collaborative, and eager to continue growing as a developer with the goal of becoming an exceptional Frontend Team Leader.",
